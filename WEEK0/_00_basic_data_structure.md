## R and R Markdown

R is a powerful programming language for the analysis of data. It is recommended that you take the introductory classes for R in **DataCamp** to get to know this language before you start coding here. In this course you will learn to use RStudio, a software that allows you to use R in a very user-friendly way.

This is a R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com> or <https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/>.

When you click the **Knit** button, a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.\

### 2 - First steps in programming

We will work with RStudio that is composed of 4 main windows/panels.\
The **Editor**, the **Console**, the **Environment** and the **Files** window/panel.

#### 2.1 The Console

The **Console** is where you type commands that you want to execute immediately and don't need to save. For example, if you want to import a data set or visualize a matrix you can type the respective commands in. To execute those commands press enter.

> Type 3 + 4 in the Console and press enter. Can you see that this code was executed immediately? Try something else!

#### 2.2 The Source

The **Source** is the panel for long codes that you are working on and that you want to save. To create a new file, go to the left top corner and click on the `New File` icon with a plus on a green circle and select for example `R Markdown`.\

In markdown,\
Two \*\* are used for **bold**\
One \* is used for *Italic*

#### 2.3 First instructions:

R instructions in a markdown file are written in a "chunk", as seen here below.\
Chunks can be added using the `+C` icon at the top right corner of this panel/editor.\
There is also a keyboard shortcut for it.

```{r Print Hello World!}
# Sentences written after "#" are comments. Comments are ignored during the execution of the code.
# print "Hello world!" on the screen.
print("Hello world!")
```

In the Markdown file, you can see the results of the command directly below the "r chunk". Importantly, you can name your chunks.\
It is useful to provide different names for the chunks to keep your markdown organized.

So, what has been done here?\
We used the function `print()` with the instruction of printing a "string", which is a sequence of "characters".

> What happens in the editor if you remove the second parenthesis? Do you see the red cross appearing? You can click on it and read the comment.\
> And what happens if you press "enter" while the second parenthesis is missing?\

Usually, `""` and `()` appear both at the same time if you are creating your script in the RStudio editor.\
This is very useful and avoid errors due to missing brackets etc ...

Instruction are saved the history of the RStudio session (see "History").\
Using the **up** and **down** arrows, you can navigate through this history directly in the RStudio Console and recall a previous instruction.

We can load the string "Hello World!" into a so-called variable using an instruction called **assignment**. An assignment does not return anything in the console. It is just done.

```{r Assigments}
a <- "Hello world!"
# or
hello <- "Hello world!"
print(a)	             
print(hello)	         
```

Note that the two variables (a and hello) are listed in the "Environment" window of RStudio.

Note: variable assignments in R can be done using either the `<-` symbol, or the `=` symbol:

```{r Assignments-2}
# these 2 commands are equivalent
a <- 2
a = 2
```

**Important!!!**\
R is case sensitive. `hello` is a known variable, but `Hello` not!\
Typing `Hello` will result in an error message:

```{r Case sensitivity, eval= FALSE}
Hello	                # Error: object 'Hello' not found
```

We can also use R as a calculator to perform mathematical operations, e.g. basic addition and multiplication:

```{r Mathematical operations}
x <- 5
y <- 3
Sum <- x+y
Sum*5
```

It is possible to delete a variable by using the function `rm()`. This function needs to be used with a lot of care!!!

```{r Removing variables}
rm(a)
```

"a" disappeared from the environment also called workspace. hello is still listed.

The function `ls()` can also give you the list of variables or objects in your workspace/environment.

```{r Listing variables}
ls()	                 
```

It can be helpful to save all the variables from the environment so that they can be re-used in ulterior sessions.\
For that, check first what is your working directory:\
Files -\> More -\> Go To Working Directory\
If it is not the correct one, navigate to the directory of your choice and set it as working directory:\
Files -\> More -\> Set As Working Directory\

You can now save the environment using the save icon under the Environment panel.\
This is saved as a .RData file.\
You can give it a specific name if you wish, e.g. MyEnvironment.RData\
After RStudio was closed, it is possible to load this environment by using the function `load()`.

```{r Loading data, eval = FALSE}
load("MyEnvironment.RData")
```

## Basic Data Structures in R

Let's explore how data is organized and displayed in R!\
First, we will introduce the basic concepts and at the end, you will find exercises related to each topic for you to practice on your own.

### 1 - Simple variables

As you have already seen, values can be assigned to variables. For the assignment, `<-` and `=` are equivalent:

```{r Assignment}
a <- 2
b <- TRUE
#or 
b = TRUE
name = 'Rosalinde'
```

The function `str()` gives you the structure of the variable.

```{r Variable structures}
str(name)
```

where chr stands for character and not for chromosomes!\

We can perform tests on simple variables using the `==`, `>`,`<` operators:

```{r Tests}
name == 'rosalinde'
name == 'Rosalinde'
a > 5
```

### 2 - Vectors

The function `c()` combines vectors of length 1 into longer vectors. The number of elements in a vector can be determined with `length()`.

```{r Assigning vectors}
x <- 9
length(x)	            # [1] 1   -> x is a vector of length 1

y <- c(x, 3, 7, 2)
length(y)	            # [1] 4   -> y is a vector of length 4
```

Vectors can be made of numbers, strings and characters or logicals (TRUE, FALSE, NA = not available). Remember that `str()` can be used to display its structure.

```{r Vector structures}
u <- c("a", "b", "abc")
str(u)	                          # chr [1:3] "a" "b" "abc"   -> u is a vector made of characters/strings

v <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)
str(v)	                          # logi [1:4] TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE   -> v is a vector made of logicals
```

Note the difference between logical and string:

```{r}
w <- c("TRUE", "FALSE", "TRUE", "TRUE")
str(w)	                          # chr [1:4] "TRUE" "FALSE" "TRUE" "TRUE"
```

When the data types are mixed, all elements of the vector are converted into the **lowest** type:

```{r Vectors of mixed data types }
str(TRUE)	                        # logi TRUE
str("FALSE")	                    # chr "FALSE"
str(3)	                          # num 3
str(1+0i)	                        # cplx 1+0i

w <- c(TRUE, "FALSE", 3, 1+0i)
str(w)  	                        # chr [1:4] "TRUE" "FALSE" "3" "1+0i"   
                                  # all elements are converted to characters/strings
```

You can select elements of a vector. Therefore, the name of the vector is followed by brackets `[]` including the index of the element:

```{r Selecting vector elements}
y <- c(9, 3, 7, 2)

y[3]	                    # [1] 7   -> select the third element of the vector y 
y[2:4]	                  # [1] 3 7 2   -> select elements 2 to 4 
#or 
y[c(2,3,4)]               # [1] 3 7 2   -> select elements 2,3 and 4
y[4:2]	                  # [1] 2 7 3   -> select element 4 to 2
y[-2]                     # [1] 9 7 2   -> select all elements except the second
y[y < 5]                  # [1] 3 2   -> select all elements of y with value < 5
```

We can also perform **tests** on elements of a vector.\
These tests will be applied for each element:

```{r Tests on vector elements}
x <- c(1,4,3,7)
x < 4
values <- c('high','high','low','high')
values == 'high'

eval <- (values == 'high')
sum(eval)
```

> Can you explain/understand why `sum(eval)` returns 3?

You can modify elements in a vector:

```{r Modifying elements in vectors}
y <- c(9, 3, 7, 2) 	      # [1] 9  3  7  2

y[1] <- 10                # modify the first element
y	                        # [1] 10  3  7  2
                          
y[] <- 8                  # modify all elements
y	                        # [1] 8 8 8 8

y <- 8                    # assign the value 8 to the variable y
y	                        # [1] 8
```

> Can you explain the difference between `y[1]` and `y <- y[1]`?

### 3 - Matrices

A matrix is a two-dimensional **array** of numbers. They are defined using the `matrix()` function as follows:

```{r Defining matrices}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

X <- matrix(data = x, nrow = 2, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
X

X <- matrix(data = x, nrow = 2, ncol = 3, byrow = FALSE)
X
```

> Do you understand all parameters ("nrow", "ncol", "byrow") of the `matrix()` function? What happens if you do not specify "byrow" as TRUE or FALSE?

> If you need further information on a specific function, you can type `help(xxx)` or `?xxx` in the Console, e.g. help(matrix) or ?matrix.

You can ask for the **dimension** of a matrix (and see later also for data frames) using the function `dim()`.

```{r Dimension of a matrix}
dim(X)     # [1] 2 3 -> two rows, 3 columns
```

To access the elements of a matrix, it is similar to the vector but with 2 indexes:

```{r Accessing Matrices}
X[1, 2]	                    # [1] 3  -> element in the first row and second column
                            
X[1:2, 1]	                  # [1] 1 2	

X[2, ]	                    # [1] 2 4 6	 -> all elements of the second row
                            
length(X[1:2, 1])	          # [1] 2  -> X[1:2, 1] is a vector of length 2
```

It is possible to remain in 2 dimensions, when setting the parameter **drop = FALSE**.

```{r }
X[1:2, 1, drop = FALSE]

dim(X[1:2, 1, drop = FALSE])    # [1] 2 1 -> 2 rows, 1 column
```

We can also build a matrix by joining multiple column-vectors using `cbind()`:

```{r building matrices using cbind}
# create 3 vectors of 5 numbers each
x = c(1:5)
y = c(6:10)
z = c(11:15)

# now join these 3 columns into a matrix
A = cbind(x,y,z)
A
```

> What happens if you use `rbind()` instead of `cbind()`? Try it!

We can give column/row names to the matrix A:

```{r Row/Colum names of a matrix}
A
rownames(A) = letters[1:5]
colnames(A) = c('patient1','patient2', 'patient3')
A
```

To open a new bar in the window above displaying the matrix, you can use the function `View()`:

```{r View, eval = FALSE}
View(A)
```

### 4 - Lists

**Lists** are very flexible structures and can contain **various types of elements**.\
Elements of a list can be named, which can be helpful. We can build a list using the `list()` function:

```{r Building lists}
List1 <- list(color = c("blue", "red"), size = 5, state = TRUE) 
# -> create a list with three elements: color, size and state

List1
```

We can access the elements of this list using the `$` sign or brackets `[[]]` and their name:

```{r Accessing named lists}

List1$color                  
List1[["color"]]             
length(List1[["color"]])      # This is of length = 2

# but 
List1["color"]              
length(List1["color"])        # This is of length = 1
```

> Can you explain the difference between `List1["color"]` and `List1[["color"]]`?

> What would happen if you type `List1["color"][2]`? Try it!

How does it look for a list without named elements?

```{r Accessing unnamed lists}
List2 <- list(c("blue", "red"), 5, TRUE)
List2

List2[1]	                  # First element of List2

List2[[1]]	                # Content of the first element of List2

List2[[1]][2]	              # Second position of the first element of List2
```

How to remove an element from a list?

```{r}
List2[[3]] <- NULL
```

### 5 - Dataframes

Data frames are like matrices, but they can contain **multiple types** of values mixed.\
We can create a data frame using the `data.frame()` function. We can also convert a matrix into a data frame with `as.data.frame()`.

We can prepare three vectors of the same length (for example 4 elements) and create a data frame:

```{r}
Name <- c("Ben", "Alice", "Daniel", "Charlie")
Year <- c(1990, 1992, 1995, 1993)
Option <- c("Biology","Physics", "Chemistry", "Mathematics")

Students <- data.frame(First_Name = Name, Year = Year, Options = Option)
Students
```

Data frames can be indexed similar to lists and matrices:

```{r Acessing elements of a data frame}

Students$Year           # [1] 1990 1992 1995 1993  -> select the column "Year"
#or
Students[["Year"]]
#or 
Students[, 2]

Students$Options[3]     # [1] Chemistry   -> access element 3 of the column "Options"

Students[2:3, 3]        # [1] Physics   Chemistry  -> select elements 2 and 3 of column 3 
```

There are important differences between data frames and matrices!\
We can create a matrix "Mat" and convert it to a data frame "Df":

```{r Differences data frames and matrices}
m <- c(1:20)
Mat = matrix(data = m, nrow = 4, ncol = 5)
Df = as.data.frame(Mat)

# Now, execute the following:
Mat[2,3]
Df[2,3]

Mat[4]
Df[4]
```

> Do you see and understand the difference?

Data frames can be **merged**.\
For example, create a second data frame ("Full_Names"), with partial information from the "Students" data frame, and merge these two data frames:

```{r}
Full_Names <- data.frame(First_Name = c("Alice","Ben","Daniel"),
                         Last_Name = c("Parker","James","Brown"))

merge(Students, Full_Names)
```

By defaults, "all" is set to FALSE and only elements with entries in both data frames are merged. Can you see the difference when setting "all" to TRUE?

```{r}
merge(Students, Full_Names, all=TRUE)
Students <- merge(Students, Full_Names, all=TRUE)
```

Remember that help on the function `merge()` can be obtained with `?merge` or `help(merge)`.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

#### Vectors

1.  Create a vector named "test_scores" containing the test scores 75, 90, 65, 68 and 83 of students.

2.  Create a vector "passing" that contains TRUE for test scores above 70 and FALSE for scores equal or below 70. *Hint*: Remember that you can perform tests on vector elements.\
    Use `sum()` to check how many students passed the test.

3.  *(expert)* Can you create a vector "high_scores" that contains only scores above 70, using the results obtained in 1. and 2.?

```{r Exercise 1 Solution}
# SOLUTION

```

### Exercise 2

#### Matrices

1.  Create a matrix that looks like this:

```{r}
#      [,1] [,2] [,3]

# [3,]    3    5    7
# [4,]    2    9    11
```

2.  Select different parts of the matrix, for example:

    -   the element of the second row and first column
    -   the second and third element of the second column
    -   all elements of the last column
    -   Try something else!

3.  Add a new column to the matrix using `cbind()`.

Fruit <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)
Color <- c("orange", "red", "green", "blue", "green")
```

2.  Select the column "Fruit". How many Fruits are there? *Hint*: Remember the function `sum()`.

3.  Add a column named "Berry" containing TRUE (for products that are berries) or FALSE to the data frame.

```{r Exercise 4 Solution}
# SOLUTION
