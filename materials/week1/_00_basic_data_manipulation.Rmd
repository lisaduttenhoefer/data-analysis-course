## Data Manipulation in R

In the exercise sheet **00_Basic_Data_Structure_in_R.Rmd**, we introduced the basics of data organization in R, including vectors, matrices, lists and data frames. Here, you will learn about advanced concepts of data manipulation and iteration techniques, including **loops** (such as apply, sapply,...) and advanced **index selection** (such as which, %in%, ...). Again, you will find exercises at the end of this markdown, to practice these concepts by yourself. 

### 1 - Loops 

Sometimes, we need to repeat the same operation for all elements of a vector, or all rows/columns of a matrix or data.frame. This is a **loop**.

#### Apply, sapply, lapply

`Apply()` is used to repeat the same operation over all columns/rows of a **matrix** or **data frame**. Therefore, we need to specify three parameters:\
1. The matrix on which the operation should be performed\
2. Whether to repeat the operation over rows, which is defined by a "1", or columns (use a "2" instead)\
3. The operation that should be performed.\

Let's have a look at an example to make this more clear: We want to determine the minimum for each row of the matrix "Mat". Therefore, we can use the function `min()`. 

```{r apply for matrices}
#First, we build the matrix 
m <- rnorm(30)   # generate 30 random numbers for the matrix
Mat <- matrix(data = m, nrow = 6)
Mat

#Next, we want to determine the minimum value of each row: 
apply(Mat, 1, min)
```

> What happens if you change the "1" in the apply function to "2"? Try it!

> Remember that you can use `help(apply)` or `?apply` to get help on this function!


We can perform a loop over all elements of a **vector** or **list** using the `sapply()` function.\
`sapply()` needs two information:\
1. which vector do we consider?\
2. which function do we want to apply to each element of this vector?\
`sapply()` will return a **vector** containing the results.

For instance, we can calculate the square root of every element of a vector using the function `sqrt()`:

```{r sapply for vectors}
x <- c(1:5)
sapply(x, sqrt)
```

Instead of using built-in functions, we can also write our own little function and combine it with `sapply()`, `apply()` or `lapply()` (see below): 

```{r}
# sapply()
z <- c(1:5)
sapply(z, function(x) {x*2}) 

# apply()
Mat 
apply(Mat, 1, function(x) {sum(x*2)}) #the operation is performed on every row of "Mat"; every element is multiplied by two and the sum of the row is calculated
```

Besides, we can use `sapply()` for a **list**, for example to calculate the length of every element using `length()`: 

```{r lapply for lists}
List1 <- list(color = c("blue", "red"), size = 5, state = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE))

sapply(List1, length)
```

As you can see, this returns a vector with the length of every list element.

However, sometimes it can be useful to keep the results stored in a list. Therefore, we can use `lapply()` instead. 
Let's have a look at the difference between `sapply()` and `lapply()` using the example from above: 

```{r lapply}
lapply(List1, length)
```

> Do you understand the difference? 

#### For Loops 

Besides the apply-family, we can use **for loops** for iterating over a sequence:

```{r For loops}
x <- c("a", "b", "c")

for (i in x) {
  print(i)
}

#or 
for (i in 1:4) {
  print(i*3)
}
```

### 2 - If Statements

You can use an **if statement** to execute a block of code only, if a condition is TRUE. 

```{r If statements}
a <- 5
b <- 10

if (a < b) {
  print("a is smaller than b")
}
```

> Modify "a" or "b" and see how the output changes! 

We can also add **else if** to this statement. In that case, if the **if** condition is FALSE, the **else if** condition will be tried:

```{r else if}
a <- 10
b <- 10

if (a < b) {
  print("a is smaller than b")
} else if (a == b) {
  print("a is equal to b")
}
```

Besides, we can add an **else** statement to be executed when all previous conditions are not TRUE. 

```{r else}
a <- 10
b <- 5

if (a < b) {
  print("a is smaller than b")
} else if (a == b) {
  print("a is equal to b")
} else {
  print("a is greater than b")
}

```

> Do you understand how this works? What would happen if a = 10 and b = 10? Try it!

There is also a more compact way if you want to test only one condition: the `ifelse()` function.\
The syntax of this function is:\
`ifelse(test, return values when the test is TRUE, return values when FALSE)`. 

```{r Ifelse}
a <- 5
b <- 10

ifelse(a < b, "a is smaller than b", "a is greater or equal to b")
```

### 3 - Subset selection

#### which

The `which()` function can be very useful if you want to select elements by a specific condition. `which()` returns the **positions** of all elements that satisfy this condition. 

```{r Which}
a <- c(3, 5, 10, 4, 2, 6, 7, 2)

which(a < 5) # returns the positions of the elements smaller than 5

# To get the values of these elements instead of their position, we can do the following:
a[which(a < 5)]
```

> Do you understand the difference between `which(a < 5)` and `a[which(a < 5)]`?

#### %in%

We can use `%in%` to check which elements of a first vector are inside a second vector: 

```{r in}
x <- c("a", "h", "f", "b", "d") 
y <- c("a", "b", "c", "d")

x %in% y
```

> What would happen if you swap "x" and "y"? Try it!

We can also combine `which` and `%in%`: 

```{r which and in}
which(x %in% y) #to get the position of elements of x that are in y

x[which(x %in% y)] #to get the values of x that are in y 
```


### Exercises 

#### Exercise 1 

1. Use `apply()` to calculate the mean values of each **row** of the matrix "M" with the `mean()` function. 

2. How would you calculate the mean for every **column**?

3. Use `which()` to determine the positions of all elements that are positive (>0). Can you determine the values of these elements instead of their position?

```{r Exercise 1}
M <- matrix(rnorm(20), nrow = 5) #built a matrix containing 20 random numbers 
```


```{r Exercise 1 Solution}
# SOLUTION

```

#### Exercise 2

1. Can you complete this **if statement**, so that if "a" is greater than zero, "a is positive" is printed, and otherwise "a is negative" is printed?

2. Can you add an **else if** statement to print "a is zero" if "a" equals zero? 

3. Try different values for "a" to check if your code works. 

```{r Exercise 2, eval = FALSE}
a <- 3

if () {
  
} else {
  
}
```

```{r Exercise 2 Solution}
# SOLUTION

```

#### Exercise 3 *(expert)*

1. *(expert)* Can you combine `sapply()` and `ifelse()` to return the square root of the vector elements of "y", if their value is greater than zero, and to return zero otherwise?\
*Hint*: Write your own function within the `sapply()` loop. Use `sqrt()` to calculate the square root. 

```{r Exercise 3}
y <- c(1, 3, -5, 4, -10)
```


```{r Exercise 3 Solution}
#SOLUTION

```
